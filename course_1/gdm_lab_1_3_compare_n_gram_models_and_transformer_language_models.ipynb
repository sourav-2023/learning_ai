        "\n",
        "As you have seen in the previous labs, neither of these methods are ideal. Assigning probabilities manually, on the one hand, would be too time-intensive in practice and it would be impossible to list all possible prompts. The n-gram models, on the other hand, often produced generations that did not make sense due to their short context window, or the model failed to generate a sequence of tokens at all due to the sparsity in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will experiment with a more advanced language model based on the **transformer architecture**. The transformer architecture is an example of a neural network model, a class of sophisticated machine learning models that can learn very complex patterns from data. Transformers provide the foundation for modern large language models. These models are much better at producing coherent responses to arbitrary prompts than n-gram models.\n",

In the case of a language model, the task is to predict the next token based on a prompt. When you estimated the probabilities of the n-gram models using the counts in a corpus, you also trained the model. The output of the training process are **parameters** of the model. These parameters guide the model to perform whatever task it was trained to do. In case of the n-gram language model, the model parameters were the conditional probabilities. In case of transformer models, the parameters are a (often very large) collection of numbers that determine the model behavior. A single one of these numbers does not mean anything but in combination, these numbers capture many patterns about language. In the case of Gemma-1B, there are around 1 billion such numbers, which gives this model its name.\n",

        "You likely made some of the following observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Fluency**: The Gemma-1B model tends to be much more fluent than the trigram model and generates texts that follow the rules of English. The trigram model tends to generate sequences where short phrases are fluent but globally there may be many mistakes. This is again caused by the small context window of the n-gram model.\n",
        "2. **Coherence**: While not always perfect, the Gemma-1B model also produces more coherent generations than the trigram model. While you may sometimes observe generations by both models that do not make any sense or go off topic, this tends to be much less of a problem with transformer models such as Gemma.\n",
        "3. **Relevance**: The trigram model is rarely able to produce relevant responses. This becomes particularly pronounced when you use a question as a prompt. The Gemma-1B model again performs much better against this criterion.\n",
        "4. **Bias**: Language models tend to suffer from similar biases in the data that they were trained on. For example, if you compare several generations of the models for the prompts \"The nurse went to university in Ethiopia.\" and \"The doctor went to university in Ethiopia.\", you will likely observe that the Gemma-1B model continues  more often with female pronouns such as \"she\" or \"her\" when talking about a nurse, and more often with male pronouns such as \"he\" and \"him\" when talking about a doctor. This is because there tend to be many more texts about male doctors and female nurses than the other way round. When models are trained from generally available texts, they likely also learn such undesirable patterns. The trigram model tends to suffer from similar biases but since it rarely generates coherent responses it cannot really be used in practice (as you may have noticed it generates continuations about coffee for these two prompts).\n",

As discussed in the previous labs, this is because the model uses a probability distribution to pick the next token, which introduces a level of stochasticity (randomness) into the prediction. As mentioned before, this variability helps the model generate more diverse and creative outputs. It allows users to regenerate a different response if they are not satisfied with the initial one.\n"

        "You have now directly compared the generations of a trigram model and a transformer model and have observed many differences. These comparisons highlighted contrasts in terms of fluency, coherence and relevance between the two models. While the n-gram model often generated word salads or failed to generate a continuation at all, the transformer model generally generated quite reasonable responses (though sometimes they may have not been entirely perfect either).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that this comparison was stacked against the n-gram model. That is because the difference between the trigram model and the Gemma-1B model, which were both trained on the Africa Galore dataset, is not only one of implementation. The Gemma-1B model has also been trained on a very large dataset. In comparison, the trigram model has only been trained on the paragraphs in the Africa Galore dataset. That being said, even if you had trained the n-gram model on as much data as the Gemma-1B model, the transformer model would have still performed much better.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two primary reasons for this:\n",
        "- Transformers have much larger context windows and can therefore consider the information of tokens that are further away from the token to be generated. N-gram models, on the other hand, only have a context window of $n-1$. So in the case of the trigram model, the model only considered the last two tokens for making predictions.\n",
        "- Transformers are based on neural networks that can learn **sophisticated** and **abstract** patterns. As you will learn more in later courses, neural networks can learn much more sophisticated patterns, and for example can learn that *food* and *snack* have related meanings. This allows the model to abstract away from specific words and learn more general patterns about language, which in return allows it to generate more diverse and more coherent responses."
